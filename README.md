I'm a technical writer at Open Web Docs, working on MDN Web Docs. I work on a mixture of:

- writing projects
- things that are more about documentation infrastructure
- day to day reviewing PRs to, and fixing issues on, the mdn/content repo.

I'm interested in all the ways we can make web docs more useful, consistent, correct, and maintainable.
