**Please note, I'm on vacation until June 18 and won't be responsive to anything on here.**

I'm a technical writer at [Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org/), working on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/). I work on a mixture of:

- writing projects
- things that are more about documentation infrastructure
- day to day reviewing PRs to, and fixing issues on, the [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content/) repo.

I'm interested in all the ways we can make web docs more useful, consistent, correct, and maintainable.
